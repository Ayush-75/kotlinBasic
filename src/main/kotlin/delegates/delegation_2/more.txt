Why Delegation is Often Superior to Inheritance

Flexibility and Extensibility:
Inheritance: If you need to change or add behaviors, you may need to modify the parent class,
 which can affect all child classes.
Delegation: You can change the delegate object at runtime,
allowing for more flexible and dynamic behavior changes without affecting the delegating class.
Avoiding the Fragile Base Class Problem:

Inheritance: Changes in the parent class can inadvertently break child classes.
Delegation: Delegating classes are isolated from changes in the delegate classes, reducing the risk of unwanted side effects.
Multiple Behaviors:

Inheritance: Java, for instance, doesn't support multiple inheritance (a class can only extend one parent class).
Delegation: A class can delegate behaviors to multiple delegate objects, effectively achieving multiple behavioral inheritances.
Encapsulation:

Inheritance: Inherits implementation details, exposing internal workings of the parent class.
Delegation: Only exposes the behavior it delegates, keeping implementation details encapsulated within the delegate class.
Easy Analogy
Imagine you run a small bakery.

Inheritance (Family Tradition):
You inherit your bakery skills from your parents who were bakers. You learn all their recipes and methods.
Pros: You immediately adopt their proven methods.
Cons: If your parents change their recipes or methods, you must followâ€”even if you think there's a better way.

Delegation (Hiring Experts):
Instead of inheriting skills directly, you hire specialized bakers to handle specific tasks.
 One is great at making bread, another excels at pastries.
Pros: You can easily replace the bread baker if someone better comes along,
or if you want to change the bread recipe without affecting pastry making.
Cons: Initially, it might take some effort to manage multiple experts.
